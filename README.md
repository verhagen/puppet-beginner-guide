## Launch Puppet through Vagrant


### Choose the Ubuntu Release

- Open the file `Vagrantfile` for editing.
- Remove the hash `#` for the Ubuntu release that should be used 

**TIP:** Ubuntu Xenial only support Puppet 4. The Precise and Trusty support Puppet 3 and Puppet 4.

	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/precise64"
	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/trusty64"
	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/xenial64"
