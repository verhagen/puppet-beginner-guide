The following Operating System releases and Puppet releases are supported.
 
| Operating Systems | Puppet Release 3 | Puppet Release 4 |
| ------------------| :--------------: | :--------------: |
| [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) - Xenial 64  |   | :white_check_mark: |
| [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) - Trusty 64  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) - Precise 64 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

The _Puppet agent/master environment_ is created as a _Virtual environment_. The Virtual Machines will be running in
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). For creating, starting, stopping or destroying these VM's
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is used.

The `Vagrantfile` contains the description of the two virtual machines. The _Puppet agent_ and _Puppet master_.
These VM's are connected through a virtual network.

The Vagrant base-boxes are from the official [Ubuntu at HasiCorp](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/) repository.


## Prerequisites

The following tools should be installed for using thies _getting started_ project. They are available for:
OS-X, Linux and Windows.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)


## Launch Puppet through Vagrant


### Choose the Ubuntu Release

- Open the file `Vagrantfile` for editing.
- Remove the hash `#` for the Ubuntu release that should be used 

**TIP:** Ubuntu Xenial only support Puppet 4. The Precise and Trusty support Puppet 3 and Puppet 4.

**WARNING:** Puppet 3 is end of life see the [platform-support-lifecycle](https://puppet.com/content/platform-support-lifecycle)

	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/precise64"    # Supports Puppet v3 and v4
	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/trusty64"     # Supports Puppet v3 and v4
	#VM_BOX = "ubuntu/xenial64"     # Supports Puppet v4 only


### Choose Puppet v3 or v4

In the files `agent.sh` and `master.sh` is defined which Puppet version is used. 

**Puppet Agent** Remove the hashes, for the version to install 

- Open the file `agent.sh` for editing.
- Remove the hashes of the lines, under the Puppet release that should be used.  

```
# Puppet 4
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#apt-get update
#apt-get install -y puppet-agent

# Puppet 3
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
#dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
#apt-get update
#apt-get install -y puppet
```


**Puppet Master** Remove the hashes, for the version to install 

- Open the file `master.sh` for editing.
- Remove the hashes of the lines, under the Puppet release that should be used.  

```
# Puppet 4
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb

# Puppet 3
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
#dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb

apt-get update
apt-get install -y puppetserver
```


### Creating / Starting / Stopping / Destroying the Puppet Agent and Master

Once the environment is launched, the files from this directory are synchronized with the
Virtual Machines. In the VM they are located in `/vagrant`. 


**Launch the environment** Installs and starts the agent and master as Virtual Machines

	vagrant up

**Stop the environment** Stops the agent and master Virtual Machines. 

	vagrant halt

**Remove the environment** Stops the agent and master and removes the Virtual Machines.

	vagrant destroy

**Loggin into environment**

	vagrant ssh agent
	vagrant ssh puppet
